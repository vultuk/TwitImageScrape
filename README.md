TwitImageScrape
===============

Scrape Twitter Images

Currently it downloads pictures from Twitpic and Instagram based on given search terms. 

It doesn't use the Twitter API which means it can search unlimited pages. 

It also uses multi threading meaning it can download lots of pictures in very short time.



It does need some more love, for example adding more services to it. You are all more than welcome to help out by adding the correct regular expressions to the bottom of the services.py file.

Apart from that, just run the scrape.py file (Important: It needs Python 3!!) and enter your search terms. e.g. #thongthursday and hit enter. The images will then be downloaded into the images directory. It will download a LOT of images very fast. In fact you will probably find that it will max out your internet connection pretty fast when doing multiple searches (which it will do)

Anyways. Enjoy
